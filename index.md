### biokit
[biokit](http://github.com/jonathanlocke/biokit) is a development kit for java bioinformatics applications. i understand how things work best by modeling them in code and so biokit is my way of learning about biology. while it is just a tiny baby step at this point, constructive feedback is always welcome.
