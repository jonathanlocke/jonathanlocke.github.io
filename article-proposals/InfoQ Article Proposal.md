InfoQ Article Proposal

**The proposed title**

*Introducing KivaKit: An integrated set of mini-frameworks for Java application development*

**Topic focus**

An overview of the design and basic use of a new Java framework.

**The target reader for the article**

Any adventuresome, cutting-edge Java developer who wants to explore a new, pure- Java application framework with a unique design that focuses on simplicity and ease-of-use.

**Technologies and tools discussed in the article**

Java 11+, KivaKit, Design Patterns (Broadcaster / Listener, Service Locator, Mixins, others), Java Services and SPIs

**Any case studies and uses cases you may cover**

Building a modular application with reusable components.

**Any code examples you will include**

Will develop a small application throughout the article demonstrating the most central features of KivaKit. The application will be made available on GitHub.

**5 key takeaways of the article**

1. KivaKit is a new application framework with a unique design that is composed of a set of integrated, but separately useful "mini-frameworks" (see https://state-of-the-art.org for a diagram and a general sense of the framework)
1. The reader should understand the purpose and use of each mini-framework and how they integrate to produce better API usability
1. The reader should understand how KivaKit's design differs from other frameworks
1. The reader should be able to use some basic features of core KivaKit in a new or existing application
1. The reader should feel encouraged to contribute feedback or to work on the open source project

**The timeframe in which you plan to submit your completed draft**

Within three weeks or less, most likely less.

**A brief (one paragraph) biography**

Jonathan has been working with Java since 1996, and he was a member of the Sun Microsystems Java Team. As an open source author, he is originator of the Apache Wicket web framework (https://wicket.apache.org), as well as KivaKit (https://www.kivakit.org) and Lexakai (a tool for producing UML diagrams and Markdown indexes from Java source code, available at https://www.lexakai.org). Jonathan works as a Principal Software Architect at Telenav (https://www.telenav.com), and in the future, Telenav will release further toolkit designed and lead by Jonathan called MesaKit, focused on map analysis and navigation.
